"""
Use the Library class below for this coding exercise.

  class Library:
    """List of available books and list of books on loan"""
    def __init__(self):
      self.available = []
      self.on_loan = []

Create the following methods for the Library class:

      add_books - takes a list of book titles (strings) and adds each title to the list of available books
      borrow_book - takes a book title (string) and moves it from the available list to the list of books on loan
      return_book - takes a book title (string) and moves it from the list of books on loan to the list of available books
