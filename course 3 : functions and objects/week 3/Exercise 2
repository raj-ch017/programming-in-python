"""
Define the class Observation which will help record observational data from a scientific outpost in Antarctica. 
The class should have a constructor that accepts parameters for date, temperature, elevation, precipitation, and penguins. 
Since Antarctica is a desert, precipitation should default to 0.

      date- String with the date of the observation, e.g. "October 26, 2019"
      temperature - Float with the temperature in Celsius, e.g. -47
      elevation - Float with elevation in meters, e.g. 329.4
      penguins - Integer representing the number of penguins observed, e.g. 3
      precipitation- Float with precipitation in centimeters, e.g. 0.7
