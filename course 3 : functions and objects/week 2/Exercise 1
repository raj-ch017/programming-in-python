"""
Write a recursive function called recursive_sum that takes an integer as a parameter. 
Return the sum of all integers between 0 and the number passed to recursive_sum.

Expected Output:

      If the function call is recursive_sum(5), then the function would return 15
      If the function call is recursive_sum(10), then the function would return 55
