# Exercise 5

"""
Write a program that reads a comma delimited CSV file and prints all of the cities which reside in the Southern Hemisphere. 
Note, any latitude with a negative value is south of the equator.

Expected Output:

The CSV file will look something like the one below. Note, there will be a row with header titles.

      City	Country	Latitude	Longitude

      Beijing	China	39	116
      Perth	Australia	-57	115
      Port Moresby	Papua New Guinea	-25	147
      Tokyo	Japan	35	139


The first two lines of your code must look like this:
    import sys, csv

    test_file = sys.argv[1]


This allows for different text files to be sent to your program for testing. 
Hint, to open the file use with open(test_file, "r".... The TRY IT button below will send a test file to your program. 

You should see the following output:

    The following cities are in the Southern Hemisphere: Perth, Port Moresby.

import sys

  if latitude < 0:
    city_list.append(city)
