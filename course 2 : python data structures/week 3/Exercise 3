"""
Write a program that reads a text file and prints the contents in reverse order.

Expected Output:

The first two lines of your code must look like this:

  import sys

  test_file = sys.argv[1]
  
This allows for different text files to be sent to your program for testing. 

Hint, to open the file use with open(test_file, "r".... The TRY IT button below will send a test file to your program. 

You should see the following output:


    The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, 
    and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.
    ‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’
    ‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M. Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’
    ‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’
    He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. 
    You are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’

import sys

  the_content = input_file.readlines()

the_content.reverse()
