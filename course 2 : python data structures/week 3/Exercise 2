"""
Write a program that reads a comma delimited CSV file with four columns and returns the average of each column in the file.

Expected Output:


The first two lines of your code must look like this:

  import sys

  test_file = sys.argv[1]
  
This allows for different text files to be sent to your program for testing. 
Hint, to open the file use with open(test_file, "r".... The TRY IT button below will send a test file to your program. 

You should see the following output:

    10.0 8.0 6.0 20.0

import sys
import csv

test_file = sys.argv[1]


l1 = []
l2 = []
l3 = []
l4 = []

with open(test_file,"r") as input_file:
  the_content = csv.reader(input_file, delimiter = ",")
