"""
Write a program that reads a tab delimited CSV file and prints the name of the oldest person in the file.

Expected Output:

  The CSV file will look something like the one below. Note, there will be a row with header titles.

      Name	Age	Career

      Peter	38	Doctor
      Paul	41	Lawyer
      Mary	32	Systems Engineer
      
      
The first two lines of your code must look like this:

      import sys, csv

      test_file = sys.argv[1]
      
      
This allows for different text files to be sent to your program for testing. 
Hint, to open the file use with open(test_file, "r".... The TRY IT button below will send a test file to your program. 

You should see the following output:

      The oldest person is Paul.
"""

import sys
import csv

test_file = sys.argv[1]

the_dict = {}

with open(test_file,"r") as input_file:
  the_content = csv.reader(input_file, delimiter = "\t")
  next(the_content)
  for name,age, ocp in the_content:
    the_dict[name] = age

the_age = max(the_dict.values())

for peeps in the_dict:
  if (the_dict[peeps] == the_age):
    print("The oldest person is {}.".format(peeps))
  else:
    pass
