"""
Write a program that reads a text file and returns the number of lines as well as the total number of characters in the file.


Expected Output:

The first two lines of your code must look like this:

  import sys

  test_file = sys.argv[1]

This allows for different text files to be sent to your program for testing.

Hint, to open the file use with open(test_file, "r".... The TRY IT button below will send a test file to your program. 

You should see the following output:

    4 lines
    231 characters
"""

import sys

test_file = sys.argv[1]

line_count = 0
char_count = 0

with open(test_file,"r") as input_file:
  the_contents = input_file.readlines()

for line in the_contents:
  line_count += 1
  for chars in line:
    char_count += 1

print("{} lines".format(line_count))
print("{} characters".format(char_count))
