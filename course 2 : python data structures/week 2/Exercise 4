# Exercise 4

"""
Write a program that takes input from a user. Print the first half of the string on one line, and the second half on another. 
In the case of a string that has an odd number of characters, the second line will have the extra character. 
Important, do not put a prompt when asking for user input. Just use input(). 
Adding a prompt will cause your program to not pass the tests.


Expected Output:

  If the user inputs home, the output will be:

      ho
      me

  If the user inputs hooray Python, the output will be:

      hooray
        Python

user_give = input()

x = len(user_give)
y = x // 2

if (x%2 == 0):
  print(user_give[:y])
  print(user_give[y:])

if (x%2 == 1):
  print(user_give[:y])
  print(" " + user_give[y:])
