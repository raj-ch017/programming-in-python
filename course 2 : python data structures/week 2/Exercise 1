"""
Write a program that takes input from a user and prints the first character of the input and the last character with some context. 
Important, do not put a prompt when asking for user input. Just use input(). Adding a prompt will cause your program to not pass the tests.

Expected Output:

    If baseball then you will print b is the first character and l is the last character
    If cat then you will print c is the first character and t is the last character

last_char = user_give[-1]
print("{} is the first character and {} is the last character".format(first_char,last_char))
