"""
Use the CelestialBody class to the left as the parent class. 
Create the Satellite and Planet classes, both of which are children of CelestialBody. 
Using the super() keyword to extend the __init__ method of the parent class, add the attribute host_planet to the 
Satellite class and add the attribute host_star to the Planet class.

Expected Attributes:

  After extending the __init__ method, your classes should have the following attributes.

      CelestialBody	Satellite	Planet

      size	size	size
      mass	mass	mass
      composition	composition	composition
      name	name	name
      host_planet	host_star
