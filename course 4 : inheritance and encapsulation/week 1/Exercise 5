"""
Use the parent classes to the left to help you solve this problem. 
The first parent is the Person class with some very generic information. 
The second class, CardHolder, is the class for a credit card holder. Create the child class PlantinumClient. 
This class inherits all of the attributes of both parent classes. In addition, the child class has the attributes cash_back and rewards. 
cash_back should be set to 0.02 and rewards should be set to 0. 
Override the process_sale method so that 2% of each sale is added to rewards.
